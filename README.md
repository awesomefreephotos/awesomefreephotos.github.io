# Free Stock Images Directory
http://awesomefreephotos.github.io

There are many lists of free stock photography sources. However, these lists tend to go out of date and are rarely updated. They offer links to many of the same resources, but no list is quite the same, so you keep searching, hoping you're not missing that one site. This list allows us to collaborate on building a master list of these sites. Please contribute new sites as you discover or create them.

### Add or update a stock images site.

Each site has it's own file in the [_imagesites](https://github.com/dpfavand/free-stock-images/tree/gh-pages/_imagesites) directory.

The easiest way to update is to just click the edit button on a file on GitHub, or the add button in the directory. GitHub will ask you to create a new fork. Make your changes, and submit a pull request back to the main repository. If everything looks good, the PR will be merged in as soon as the maintainer can get to it.

Just send a pull request with a new or updated file.  See [unsplash.md](https://github.com/dpfavand/free-stock-images/blob/gh-pages/_imagesites/unsplash.md) for a commented example of how to format a site data file. (You'll have to click the edit button or view the raw file to see the markdown and yaml.)
